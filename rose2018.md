# 1st International Workshop on Robotics Software Engineering (RoSE'18) 


- Co-located with [ICSE 2018](https://www.icse2018.org/) 
- in Gothenburg, Sweden 
- May 28, 2018

## Theme & Goals

Robotics is one of the most challenging domains for software engineering. Deploying even simple applications requires integrating solutions from experts of various domains, including navigation, path planning, manipulation, localization, human-robot interaction, etc. Integration of modules contributed by respective domain experts is one of the key challenges in engineering software-centric systems, yet only one of the cross-cutting software concerns crucial to robotics. As robots often operate in dynamic, partially observable environments additional challenges include adaptability, robustness, safety, and security.

The goal of RoSE 2018 is to bring together researchers from participating domains with practitioners to identify new frontiers in robotics software engineering, discuss challenges raised by real-world applications, and transfer latest insights from research to industry. RoSE 2018 will solicit contributions from both academic and industrial participants, thus fostering active synergy between the two communities.

## Topics of Interest

RoSE 2018 seeks contributions addressing, but not limited to, the following topics related to robotics software engineering:
- Analysis of challenges in robotic software engineering
- Architectures that lead to reusable robotic software engineering
- Challenges for defining and integrating domain-specific languages for the design of robotic systems
- Continuous integration and deployment in robotics
- Description and analysis of design principles promoting service quality attributes (e.g., performance, energy efficiency)
- Engineering the collaboration of multiple (heterogeneous) robots
- Identification and description of design principles in robot software architectures
- Lessons learned in the engineering and deployment of large-scale, real-world integrated robot software architectures
- Machine learning in safety-critical domains
- Metrics to measure non-functional properties (e.g., robustness, availability, etc.) and their application
- State-of-the-art research projects, innovative ideas, and field-based studies
- Software engineering best practices in robotics
- Processes and tools supporting engineering and development of robotic systems
- Variability, modularity, and reusability in robotics
- Validation and verification of robot software

## Workshop Program 

### Session 1: Introduction and Keynote (09:00 - 10:30)

- Opening by the organizers (09:00 - 09:10)

- Keynote: Lars Asplund - Robotics Now and in the Future - Special Needs in Robotic Programming (09:10 - 10:30)

The talk will start with an overview of robotics development in the last years, and why robotics is taken off right now. This will cover different kinds of robots and special attention will be put on the software that is required in robotic systems. This includes, for instance, real-time systems, AI-systems, embedded systems and distributed systems. What about safety? What are the special needs in all these areas?

Professor emeritus Lars Asplund at Mälardlaen University has a PhD in physics with Laureate Kai Siegbahn, but changed direction into computer science after some years. Done research in molecular physics, embedded systems. distributed systems, learning systems, real-time systems, and robotics. Written 10 textbooks in electronics and robotics. One of the founders of Robotdalen – a triple helix in Sweden for robotics. Founder of two companies in robotics, Robyn Robotics AB, and Unibap AB. Robyn Robotics are producing a robot cat for people with dementia and is sold in ten countries. Unibap listed on the stock exchange Nasdaq First North is using modern AI and computer science methods to give industrial robots ability to see and think and produces computer systems that are used in satellites. First test systems were launched in 2016.
