### Mission

The mission of the RoSE workshop series is to **bring together researchers from robotics and software engineering and with practitioners to identify new frontiers in robotics software engineering**, discuss challenges raised by real-world applications, and transfer latest insights from research to industry. 

RoSE aims at gathering contributions from both academic and industrial actors, thus fostering active synergy between the two communities.

RoSE is held on a yearly cycle. The first edition was co-located with ICSE and the plan is to colocate RoSE with top conferences either in the SE or robotic areas.
